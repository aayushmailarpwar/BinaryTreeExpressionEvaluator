I am using the Composite Pattern, Visitor Pattern and Builder Pattern

Composite Pattern - This pattern is to represent the Expr Node in a tree structure 
Expr node is the parent of Binary and Unary, Binary, Number is the parent of Add, Sub,
Mul, Div

Visitor Pattern - This is to evaluate the Tree using the post order traversal using the left and right and accept methods and returning the result

Builder Patter - The where you build the Binary Expression Tree with the appropriate 
precedence, parenthesis and structure
